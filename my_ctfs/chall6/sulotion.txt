Challenge 6 Solution:

Part A:

The challenge is based on a Palestine Army theme (satirical and not real, of course). At the beginning, you'll see five characters and a "Recruit" button.
The "Recruit" button is essentially a login—but for now, there is no way to pass it.

Some of the characters are clickable and lead to their own pages.
The user should recognize a pattern and navigate to the Anonymous character’s page.

Once there, the user will notice that a picture is missing—other characters each have three images, but Anonymous only has two.
The missing image can be found in an HTML comment—it is the logo image.

Part B:

The user now sees a picture with some strange white lines.
If they read the previous comment ("What are those white lines? I love PIL"), they should understand that the image needs to be opened using PIL in Python.

Using PIL, the user can examine the pixel values.
The image is in grayscale, and the user should deduce that each non-white pixel in the first row represents an ASCII value of a letter.

This reveals the hidden message:
"note to myself: username is: HA!CK#R_GAZA"

Next, the user should check the description of Anonymous and find the line:
"Known by the alias 'Falastech'."

Using that information:

Username: HA!CK#R_GAZA

Password: Falastech

This allows the user to log in and access the Anonymous workspace.

Part C:

Inside the Anonymous workspace, the user will find the flag clearly visible, completing the main challenge.

However, there's a bonus challenge hidden at the end. In the Anonymous workspace, there is a "Socials" section.
The user should notice that the social links are real and can access the Telegram bot.

They must send the message #freepalestine to the bot (as hinted on the page: "Do not forget to leave #freepalestine at the socials").
The Telegram bot then responds with an additional flag.
