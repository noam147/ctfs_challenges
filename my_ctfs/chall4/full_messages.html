[05/01/19, 17:30:01] Jamie: Yo, you guys free tonight?<br>
[05/01/19, 17:30:18] Alex: Might be, what's the plan?<br>
[05/01/19, 17:30:40] Jamie: Just thinking of hanging out or maybe gaming.<br>
[05/01/19, 17:31:12] Sam: I'm down, but only if she isn't coming <br>
[05/01/19, 17:31:44] Jamie: Sam, chill. Don't start.<br>
[05/01/19, 17:32:05] Alex: Yeah let's keep it cool this time.<br>
[05/01/19, 17:32:28] Sam: Fine. Just saying.<br>
[05/01/19, 17:42:08] Alex: What's wrong with you?<br>
[05/01/19, 17:42:51] Sam: Now what?<br>
[05/01/19, 17:43:20] Alex: Why were you acting like that?<br>
[05/01/19, 17:43:28] Sam: They deserved it, didn't they?<br>
[05/01/19, 17:44:23] Alex: I don't think so.<br>
[05/01/19, 17:44:42] Sam: Seriously?<br>
[05/01/19, 17:44:48] Alex: I know they were wrong, but you shouldnâ€™t have reacted like that.<br>
[05/01/19, 17:45:00] Jamie: Yeah, Sam. You really crossed a line there.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:11:21] Alex: image omitted<br>
[05/01/19, 18:08:02] Sam: I'm not in the mood to talk right now.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:12:13] Sam: Just go!?<br>
[05/01/19, 18:12:28] Alex: Okay, you're out of the group.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:13:10] Jamie: Honestly, Sam, that was too much.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:19:16] Sam: Bye, I'll probably call you later.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:20:00] Alex: Not anymore. You're removed for good.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:20:15] Jamie: I agree, Alex. It was the right call.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:22:03] Jamie: Damn.. that escalated.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:22:20] Alex: Yeah. I hated doing it, but it had to be done.<br>
[00/67/51, 18:22:42] Jamie: He's been acting off for a while.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:23:10] Alex: I'll give him space. Maybe he'll cool off eventually.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:23:33] Jamie: Let's just keep the group chill from now on.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:24:01] Alex: Agreed. No more drama.<br>
[05/01/19, 18:24:17] Jamie: Want to still hop on tonight?<br>
[05/01/19, 18:24:31] Alex: Yeah, let's do it.<br>
