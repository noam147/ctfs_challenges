Challenge 4 Solution:

The user starts on a page displaying fake WhatsApp messages.
They should notice the reference to our_chat.txt and realize that they need to access it via the URL (/our_chat.txt).

Once opened, the file provides a hint hidden in an HTML comment.

Next, by navigating to /groups, the user encounters numerous fake WhatsApp invitation links. Only one of them is valid.
Upon finding the correct link, another HTML comment directs the user to visit /secret, where they receive a ZIP file.

The ZIP archive contains two images. The user must inspect their binary content and discover that hidden messages are appended to the end of each image file.

Using the hints provided, the user is led to /Alex_Sam and must identify the correct link by referencing the number 6751, which corresponds to the date mentioned in the fake WhatsApp messages.
