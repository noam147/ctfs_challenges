Challenge 7 Solution:

Part A:

The challenge is based on a Russian theme. At the beginning, you'll see four main sections and a "Play Music" button.
A quick inspection reveals that the music is unrelated to the actual challenge.

The four sections are:

Login – This is a honeypot section. There isn’t a valid user account for login. (If the user navigates to /admin, they can see an HTML comment advising them not to waste time on the login.)

History and Culture – This section contains only text.

Glory Page – Initially, this appears broken(to chrome users), but it’s actually intentional. If the user clicks on "Windows Scanner," they will proceed to the next part.

Part B:

The user now sees a picture and some hints via a browser alert.
The image contains an MP3 file appended to its content. The user should realize they need to look for the "ID3" tag in the file.

Once found, the user extracts a Russian audio recording.
The translation of the recording instructs the user to go to /hash, and informs them that each letter of the flag is individually hashed.

Part C:

The user needs to write a simple script to brute-force each hash in order to recover the complete flag.
