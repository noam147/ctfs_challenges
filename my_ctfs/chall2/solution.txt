Challenge 2 Solution:

The user is provided with the source code of a Python server and is required to connect to it using ncat (or another similar tool) on port 9999.
In this challenge, the user should recognize that the print function is not the standard built-in function, but a custom implementation.
By experimenting with multiple arguments passed to the print function, the user will discover that providing exactly six variables reveals the flag.
